SneakyCr0w.com is the personal website of Zachary E. Sohovich. It's an encompassment of my portfolio, biography, and contact information.

Sneaky Cr0w is in reference to two things: 

1. The Crow. The crow is a "spirit animal" of sorts that has followed me my whole life.

2. "Sneaky" is a username that I used to use in the game Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory, one of the first video games I ever played and where I got into computer programming.
