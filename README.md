# SneakyCr0w - Professional Portfolio of Zachary E Sohovich
This project is a remodel of my original website, with focus on the front-end exclusively. Considering the portfolio doesn't utilize any of the back end techs, frameworks, and tools I use, I don't see why I should bother coding it.

This project will code exclusively in front-end. I will be adding some code coverage support and then have that deploy to either heroku or netlify.
