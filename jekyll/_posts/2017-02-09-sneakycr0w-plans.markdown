So sneakycr0w.com is going to be my personal website. I don't plan on using it much more than showing my project list, having a little blog/scribble area, and minor updates to my resume and what not.

##Projects
Right now I'm in the process of writing a [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) application for the projects section. That's going to connect to a PostgreSQL database that'll just contain one table with all my projects. Easy enough.

##Scribbles
The scribbles section is simply going to be a blog. It'll contain both personal posts as well as development. But, the *primary* focus is going to be development, as this website is a professional one. At the same token, I don't want it to be too formal or impersonal because that's simply not who I am as a person.

##Miscellaneous
Lastly, I want to add more things to the homepage. Right now I don't have a lot of ideas beyond changing that banner image and adding a "buy me a coffee" panel/link, haha. I want to incorporate stripe so I can better maneuver with it, so I thought that would be a great  way to learn the API.

###Notes
I want to repeat that this blog is going to be a bunch of scriblbles. Some posts are going to be long, some super short. It's basically a notebook of my mind.
