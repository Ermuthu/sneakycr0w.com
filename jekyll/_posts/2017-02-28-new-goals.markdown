So, at the the beginning of this year I was participating in two different "marathons", so to speak. One of them was 100 days of code, which didn't really work out because I moved and then got off track and from there gained momentum of being off-track, haha. I also bought a PS4 and that has distracted me immensely. As of now, that issue is seemingly fixed. But, it's taking a lot of self-discipline.
The second "marathon" that I was participating in was this *thing* where you had to develop one project per month. Given the nature of the projects I was tasking myself with and how large they were, that didn't work out too well.

I'm formally removing my pledge from these two "marathons" and starting my own goal. This goal is to focus on iOS app development. Specifically, I have an idea for an app that I'd like to make that I want to have out by the end of the year.

This is going to encompass many things, not just coding. I'm going to be a one man team. I need to deploy marketing techniques, code the app (obviously), do research, talk with different restaurants and people to help with various parts of the app, etc. It's going to be a lot of work, but I think it's going to be a **very** good learning experience.

As of today, I'd like to formally announce that this project has **started**. More information coming soon!
