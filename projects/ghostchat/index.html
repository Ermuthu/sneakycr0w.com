    <h3>Welcome to Ghost Chat!</h3>
    <p><strong>Ghost Chat</strong> is a web application specifically designed for quick and secure interactions. Have you ever wanted to send a quick message but worry about the security of that message? That's where we come into play! All you have to do is create a room. Creating a room will generate a link you can give to another person. You post your message in the room, set an expiration time, and that's it.</p>
    <h3>Features</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Secure - all messages are encrypted</li>
      <li>No Saved Data - No sign up required and no saved messages. <strong>All</strong> messages expire after a set amount of time</li>
      <li>Easy - In a matter of a few buttons and seconds you'll have a room setup with messages going to a designated person</li>
    </ul>
