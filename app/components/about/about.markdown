# About Me
Hello there, my name is Zachary E Sohovich, and I love web development.
### Origin Story
When I was about 13 years old, I started playing a video game called Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory. The video game itself was multiplayer only, so there were a lot of communities. 

I played that game for about 8 years total, and made a lot of friends. While playing that game with those friends, we decided to start our own community. Someone needed to make a website for us, and none of us knew how. So I volunteered.

I googled how to make a website and there were a bunch of Photoshop tutorials combined with Dreamweaver. Since I was 13 and couldn't justify making my mom buy those programs for me, I googled other ways. Eventually, I found a tutorial called "How to make a website with just Notepad." That was the start of my web development experience.

I started with simple HTML & CSS. I eventually added in JS, but not much. PHP was big at the time, and so that's where I went (down the deep dark PHP hole).
